// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here) ...

if num % 2 == 0     // check if number divides cleanly by 2
    print "even"
else
    print "odd"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here) ...

a)  numbers[5] = read(numberInput)

b)  for each num in numbers         // loop thru collection
        sum += num[i]               // add to running total
        avg = sum / length(numbers)

c)  var smallest, largest = num[0]  // set up variables to hold smallest and largest, initialize values to first number in collection
    for each num in numbers         // loop thru collection
        if num[i] < smallest        // check current smallest against number under examination
            smallest = num[i]       // if smaller, update smallest value
        if num[i] > largest         // same thing but for largest ...
            largest = num[i]

d)  print(smallest, largest)
